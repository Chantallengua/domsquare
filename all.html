						You have a positive attitude and you like to explore the many different opportunities that student life has to offer. You always make sure that you have several things going on and are not afraid to take on a few extracurriculars. You like to dream big and are determined to be involved in as many things as possible. Your schedule might be packed, but at least you are never bored!

						</p>
						<p class="text-muted-50 text-justify mb-4">
						At the Dom Square, you feel right at home in the Academy Building. Together with the attached chapter house from the 15th century, this building is the beating heart of the university. Something about surrounding yourself with the same walls as, for instance, the signers of the Union of Utrecht in 1579, is extremely exciting to you. You are fascinated by the fact that Utrecht University has its roots right here, and it makes you feel like you are there to continue this legacy of almost four centuries.

						</p>
						<p class="text-muted-50 text-justify mb-4">
						Throughout the coming years you will be seeing this building a lot, perhaps even to start the board year of (one of) the student association(s) you are part of! Soon enough you will know everyone who walks around here, and one day you aspire to defend your PhD thesis here and receive the praise that you deserve.

						You like to refer to yourself as an "enjoyer of life" or a "bon vivant" if you're feeling fancy. When you entered your life as a student in Utrecht, you came to the discovery that you are happiest when you just see what the day brings you. There is always time to study later!

						</p>
						<p class="text-white text-justify mb-4">
						You like to spend time outside - either with friends or by yourself - and take in your surroundings. One of your favorite spots to hang out is the Pandhof next to the Dom Church, where you find shade during the hot days of summer, some sun in the spring and fall, and some cosy shelter in the winter. It strikes the perfect balance between being secluded from the busy outside world and at the same time having different people coming in and out all day, who you like to observe.

						</p>
						<p class="text-white text-justify mb-4">
						The fact that this nice little piece of green used to be a passageway through which the students of the Reformed School (predecessor to Utrecht University) walked to their classes is not often on your mind. If anything, it is a reassuring thought that after more than four centuries, this is still a place where students can come and overthink life's many questions and charms.

						Luckily there is always the Dom Tower, for centuries the symbol and epicentre of the city, to look up to from a distance. Not only does its everlasting presence on the Utrecht skyline comfort you, it also helps you navigate through those tiny little streets in the city centre that all look exactly the same to you.

							Sometimes you fantasize about how, before the emergence of other high buildings, the Dom Tower must have been visible from far outside the city. Even though the tower - which was once the highest building in the Netherlands! -  might not be as visible as it used to be, in your mind and in those of many other Utrechters, it remains the focal point of the city.

						You can mainly be found in the city centre around the end of the day - otherwise known as "borreltime"! When you visit Dom Square during your nocturnal adventures, you and your friends like to bring homage to the place where the social life of the Utrechtsche Studenten Corps (USC - or "Utrecht Student Corpus") started, all the way back in 1816. Even though the current USC consists mostly of party animals like yourself, you also like to remember that it started out as an association for all students all the way back in 1636.
						</p>
						<p class="text-white text-justify mb-4">
						It was only 180 years later that the first student society was founded, located in the coffee house of J. Coops right next to the Dom Tower (Servetsteeg 7). After outgrowing this tiny coffee house, the society moved to several new locations one after the other, among which most were situated at the Dom Square (back then called "Munsterplein"). Even though the buildings themselves (like 't Metalen Kruis, "The Metal Cross") are long gone, passing by you can still feel the energy of all those students that had their parties here in the past…or is that really one beer too many??

						As a young intellectual, you see it as your duty to improve the world and fight for those without a voice. You don't like it when people tell you what to do and what not to do, or that you are "too liberal". You can make up your own mind! You are persuasive and charismatic, and determined to devote all your energy to your cause.
						</p>
						<p class="text-white text-justify mb-4">
						When you visit the Dom Square, you always take some time to pass by the old house (Achter de Dom 6-10) of Anna Maria van Schurman (1607-1678), the first female university student in the Netherlands. By participating in the intellectual community of the seventeenth century, she paved the way for many women and members of other oppressed groups to do the same. You feel personally inspired by her story and strive to follow in her footsteps.
						</p>
						<p class="text-white text-justify mb-4">
						Throughout the coming years you will be seeing this building a lot, perhaps even to start the board year of (one of) the student association(s) you are part of! Soon enough you will know everyone who walks around here, and one day you aspire to defend your PhD thesis here and receive the praise that you deserve.
